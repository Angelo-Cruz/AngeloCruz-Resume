        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">EductionðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm a first-generation college student attending the University of California, Riverside. I am a second-year education major with the drive of becoming an impactful and helpful school teacher. I also want to specifically aid underfunded and under-resourced schools/school districts.
I believe anyone has the ability to academically prosper, or find joy in any form of education if given the proper resources and forms of motivation that suit an individual best. I am ready to adapt and strive to be a source of motivation for my future students, and aim to give them the resources that will best suit their learning styles/ambitions.<br><br>

        For my professional experience, I have been very active in the clubs, community service, and events that I have undertaken in the past couple of years. For 4 years I was a very active member of my church and regularly did community service. During the community service, I was often tasked with many leadership positions, which I believe I often excelled in, and was able to stay calm under times of high pressure and stress. Also, many times for my church there were events in which would be best experienced if one could fully try and immerse themselves in. Often times I was capable of immersing myself in the events and would garner much more respect for the meaning and purpose of the event and those who spent time and effort in making it happen. My ability to immerse myself in the tasks/events that I undertake is why I believe I am capable of influencing students and strive for their success.<br><br>

        Also, during high school, I became fairly involved with clubs. I became the treasurer of the French Club and was given the responsibility to look for/research possible fundraisers, keep track of the funds and spending of them, and be involved in every event that the French Club was involved in. Throughout my time as treasurer, I made sure to stay organized, involved, and provide a helping hand in any other department that I was capable of assisting in. French Club and being involved in it made me become a better team player, and I believe that skill will make me a better suit for any school/district and will further my chance of bonding with my students, and hopefully greatly impacting them. As an educator, I wish to impact my students, create great relations with my colleagues and my students, and with my love for learning I will always try to adapt and improve my teaching style in order to best suit each one of my classes.
